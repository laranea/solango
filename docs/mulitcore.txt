Solr Multicore
==============
There are many ways to configure your solr instance to handle the type of load
you are going to put on it. Solango gives you a few different choices in how to
configure Solr. Please read carefully and decide which is best for you and your
spefic use case.

Flatten
-------
By default `solango` runs off one instance of Solr and will flatten your schema
into one index. It is explained on the Solr wiki under `Flatten Data Into a 
Single Instance <http://wiki.apache.org/solr/MultipleIndexes>`_. The basic gist
of it is that if you have two models book and movie you may need the 
following::

    Book:
    
    title
    author
    release (date)
    
    Movie:

    title
    director
    release (date)
    
This would be flattened into one schema that looks like this::

    <field name="title" ... /> 
    <field name="author"  ... />
    <field name="director"  ... />
    <field name="release "  ... />

Through `solango` documents it knows how to render the two documents 
differently based on the `type` key that we automatically add.

Multiple Instances
------------------
If you do not want to flatten the index there is the ability to add multiple
instance. Books would be stored in one instance of Solr and movies in another.
This means that you will need to have Solr running on two different boxes or at
the very least different ports on the same box.

Multi Core
----------
Solr can run multiple cores on the same instance of Solr. Meaning that there
are `n` number different `schema.xml` and `data` directories on a single
instance. This can allow separation of data without having multiple instances.


Conclusion
----------
In most cases flattening the data is the best way to approach using Solr. It
gives you the ability to return multiple document type from one search without
having to make calls to separate instances of Solr. If you choose the other
route please read the MultInstance and MultiCore index documentation carefully.
